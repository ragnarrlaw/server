## Server

Simple server for testing location data handling using Golang. This application also includes the evaluation of three different Go implementations,

-   Using vanilla go for setting up servers and manipulating location relation data.
-   Using chi framework for the server setup and working with location data.
-   Using the gin framework for the server to set up the server and working with location data.

Project is organized in to three branches the `vanilla-branch` branch contains code related to the vanilla Go, branch named `chi-branch` has the code related to chi framework and the branch named `gin-branch` contains the code related to the gin framework.
